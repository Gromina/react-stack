React stack
===========

This is the skeleton of a basic single page application based on

* CoffeeScript
* Require.js to manage modules
* Facebook React for the views
* SASS and Compass for the stylesheets

I have also added a few modules that are not mandatory, but are useful common dependencies of most apps:

* Crossroads.js and Hasher to handle routing
* Prelude.ls, which is a general purpose collections and utility library
* Pajamas to fire HTTP requests and return Q promises
